# Simple CRUD API with Spring Boot

This project is a basic Spring Boot REST API demonstrating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using generic controllers for `Course` and `Student` models.

## Features

- Generic `CURDController` handling CRUD operations with in-memory storage (using a HashMap)
- `CourseController` managing `Course` entities
- `StudentController` managing `Student` entities
- Preloaded sample data for both courses and students
- REST endpoints for create, read, update, and delete operations


## Project Structure

- `model` - contains `Course` and `Student` model classes
- `controller` - contains generic `CURDController` and specific controllers `CourseController` and `StudentController`
